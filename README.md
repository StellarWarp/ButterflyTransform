# Butterfly Transform

Unity ECS Demo of Orbit Mechanics

## Unit Design

- Currently Implementation 3 types of block
  - Structural
  - Main Thruster(for orbit maneuver)
  - Side Thruster(for rotation adjestment)
 
- Move hard-coded block to data base
- Emission texture supported
- Multiple material supported
- Dynamic material supported

## Orbit Mechanics

### Stateful Physics Model

- prediection shift fixed
- implement object watch mechanism ï¼šunwatch object is excluded by orbit prediction

### Orbit Prediction

- General orbit section predication supported
- Distinct section color
- Planet-Hit prediction termination
- View Scaled orbit opacity
- Optimized by using Hermite Interpolation
- Orbit maneuver supported

### Orbit Maneuver

- Physics-based Orientation Control
- Dynamic maneuver and animated maneuver system
- Orbit state system rewrited

### Orbit Maneuver Algorithm

- Lambert solver implemented

## Unit Control

- Input System Rewrited
- Test Spawn Impeachmented


## Destruction


Demo Download see https://github.com/StellarWarp/OrbitSnadBox/releases

Operation guide:
- Right click and drag to move the camera
- Hold/release space to quickly toggle placement/selection mode
- In the selection mode, left-click to frame the object, and a circle will appear after the frame selection, which can be dragged to move the object
- Left click to place objects in placement mode
